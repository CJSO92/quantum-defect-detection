abstract = {In order to assure appearance quality of industrial products, inspection by human vision (visual inspection) is implemented in many manufacturing industries. In visual inspection, small visual defects such as cracks, scratches, dirt, nicks, stains, surface dents, and unevenness of the coating color are inspected. This study focuses on differences in defect shape on an inspection surface, and considers the relationship between defect shape and defect detection rate in visual inspection utilizing peripheral vision. Specifically, defect shapes, defect locations, and defect characteristics (luminance contrast between the defect and the inspection surface and size) are designed as experimental factors, and their effects on defect detection rate of twelve subjects are evaluated. As a result, it is obtained that the defect detection rate of line defect is lower than the other shapes (triangle, square, and circle) of defects regardless of luminance contrast between the defect and the inspection surface and size.}
