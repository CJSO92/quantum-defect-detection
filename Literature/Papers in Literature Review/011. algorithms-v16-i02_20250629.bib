ABSTRACT = {Over the last few decades, detecting surface defects has attracted significant attention as a challenging task. There are specific classes of problems that can be solved using traditional image processing techniques. However, these techniques struggle with complex textures in backgrounds, noise, and differences in lighting conditions. As a solution to this problem, deep learning has recently emerged, motivated by two main factors: accessibility to computing power and the rapid digitization of society, which enables the creation of large databases of labeled samples. This review paper aims to briefly summarize and analyze the current state of research on detecting defects using machine learning methods. First, deep learning-based detection of surface defects on industrial products is discussed from three perspectives: supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised. Secondly, the current research status of deep learning defect detection methods for X-ray images is discussed. Finally, we summarize the most common challenges and their potential solutions in surface defect detection, such as unbalanced sample identification, limited sample size, and real-time processing.},
